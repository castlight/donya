However, other implementations can be implemented that use\r\nother mechanisms to automatically format the localized text.\r\n\r\nYou can build using standard maven.  There is also an Eclipse project file.\r\n\r\nSee the org.donyasource.dony.examples directory for an examples of how this is used.\r\n\r\nFeedback and contributions welcome!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\t\r\nTo build, go to the top level directory and run:\r\n\t\r\n\tmvn package\r\n\r\nTo run the simple example, run \r\n\r\n        ./simple_example.sh en\r\n        \r\nThen try\r\n\r\n        ./simple_example.sh jv\r\n        \r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Castlight Health.
